====================================================
 DIRECTORY STRUCTURE 
====================================================

This folder (we will call it $BIOSIM_REPO) contains the following sub-directories:

- [./config/]
      Configuration files to edit before API use. These files specify the SQL 
      connection parameters and the Lucene-related parameters) 
- [./data/csv/] 
      CSV files containing the dictionary data
- [./lucene/]
      Java API to build and use the Lucene-based dictionaries
- [./lucene/scripts/] 
      Scripts to build and test the Lucene indexes.  
- [./parent/]
      Maven parent project for lucene/, sql/, and web/ 
- [./sql/]
      Hibernate mappings (Java/SQL) for the database
- [./sql/scripts/] 
      Scripts to create and populate the SQL tables
- [./uml/] 
      UML logical (Java) and physical (MySQL) models
- [./web/]
      Web interface for the Lucene-based dictionaries

====================================================
 I. CREATING THE DATABASE
====================================================
 Requirements:
 - MySQL server 5+
 
 Installation steps:
 - copy the CSV files to the /tmp directory so that MySQL can read files: 
   'cp -f $BIOSIM_REPO/data/csv/* /tmp/'
 - cd to $BIOSIM_REPO/sql/scripts/
 - To create the tables and populate the data, in MySQL:
   source db_all.sql
   For example type something like: 'mysql -u mysql -D MY_DATABASE -p < db_all.sql'
 - If you only want to create the dictionary tables:
   source biosim_dict_all.sql

 To compile the Java API (Hibernate mappings):
 - cd $BIOSIM_REPO/sql
 - mvn install

====================================================
 II. CREATING THE LUCENE INDEXES (JAVA API)
====================================================
 Requirements:
 - Java 1.5+
 - Maven 2
 
 To compile the Java API:
 - cd $BIOSIM_REPO/lucene
 - mvn package
 A JAR file containing all the compiled classes should be created in $BIOSIM_REPO/lucene/target/biosim-dictionary-lucene-api.jar
 
 To build the Lucene indexes:
 - cd $BIOSIM_REPO/lucene
 - ./scripts/lucene-build-dictionaries.sh <csv-dir> <output-dir>
          <csv-dir> path to the folder containg all the CSV files representing the dictionary data
          <output-dir>: path to the directory where all the Lucene indexes will be created
 
 To test the dictionary lookups:
 - cd $BIOSIM_REPO/lucene
 - ./scripts/lucene-lookup.sh [options]
 Options: lookup -i <index-path> -t <term> [-f <lookup-field>] [-n <max-hits>]
          list   -i <index-path>
 
 lookup: lookup a term <term> in the Lucene index at <index-path> in a particular field <lookup-field>.
 list:   list all the entries in the Lucene index at <index-path>.

====================================================
 III. BUILDING BOTH
====================================================
Make sure you read the previous sections first.
To compile 
 - cd $BIOSIM_REPO/parent
 - mvn install
